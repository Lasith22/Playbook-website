            <p>Playbookâ€™s mission is to build healthier, happier, more unified <br /> communities through sports and recreation.</p>
            <p>Our first step towards that mission is launching Play.Book app. A one <br /> stop shop for players to find the perfect venue at the perfect time, and <br /> book themselves or as a group (using our group payment feature in Club <br /> mode Matchmaking). Spend less time organizing, and more time <br /> playing. We have an exciting road map of features to come- all with <br /> the same goal of making your existing sessions easier, and more fun, and <br /> enabling new ways of having a great session. Be it finding new players <br /> to play with, or bringing it coaches to help you and your friends be your <br /> very best on the next match day!</p>
